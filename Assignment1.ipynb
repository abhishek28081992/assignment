    "Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently.\n",

    "The correct extenstion of Python file is .py\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans5:\n",
    "Python is both compiled as well as an interpreted language, which means when we run a python code, it is first compiled and \n",
    "then interpreted line by line.\n",

    "1)Python has many benefits including:\n",
    "2)Easy to learn and use: Python has a simple and straightforward syntax which makes it easy for beginners to pick up.\n",
    "3)Versatile: Python can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more.\n",
    "4)Large community: Python has a large and active community, which means there is a wealth of resources available, such as libraries and frameworks.\n",
    "5)Good for prototyping: Python's short development cycle and ease of use make it a great language for quickly prototyping ideas.\n",
    "6)Interoperability: Python can easily be integrated with other languages and tools, allowing it to be used as a \"glue\" language for connecting components.\n",
    "7)Good for data Science and analysis: Python has a number of powerful libraries, such as NumPy, Pandas, sklearn, opencv and Matplotlib, that make it a great choice for data Science and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans14:\n",
    "Python uses automatic memory management, which means the Python memory manager automatically handles memory allocation and deallocation. \n",
    "The memory manager uses a reference counting system to track the number of references to objects in memory, and frees the memory occupied by an object when its reference count reaches zero. \n",
    "Additionally, Python has a garbage collector that periodically frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer being used. This ensures that Python programs are able to efficiently use memory without the need for manual memory management.\n",

    "Ans15:\n",
    "Here's how you can install Python on Windows and set the path variables:\n",
    "1)Download the latest version of Python from the official website (https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "2)Run the installer and follow the instructions to install Python on your system.\n",
    "3)Open the \"Environment Variables\" dialog by typing \"Environment Variables\" into the Windows search bar and clicking on \"Edit the system environment variables.\"\n",
    "4)Under \"System Variables,\" scroll down and find the \"Path\" variable, then click \"Edit.\"\n",
    "5)Click \"New\" and add the path to your Python installation. For example, if you installed Python in the default location, the path would be \"C:\\PythonXX,\" where \"XX\" is the version number.\n",
    "6)Click \"OK\" to close all the dialog boxes.\n",
    "7)Open a new command prompt and type \"python\" to confirm that the installation was successful and that the path variables are set correctly.\n",
    "  Note: It may need to restart any open command prompts for the changes to take effect.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans16:\n",
    "Yes, indentation is required in Python. Indentation is used to indicate the block of code associated with control structures such as loops and conditional statements. The indentation level determines the scope of the code block, and a consistent indentation style makes the code easier to read and understand. In Python, the indentation level is defined by one or more spaces at the beginning of a line. The recommended indentation level is 4 spaces, but some developers prefer 2 spaces or use tabs instead of spaces. \n",
    "It's important to be consistent within a single project, and most code editors can automatically handle indentation for you.\n"
